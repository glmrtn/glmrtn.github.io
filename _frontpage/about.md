I love capturing moments in photographs.  Whether it's a milestone, an accomplishment or a simple snapshot of everyday life, they are all important.  I like to think of every photo of a small time-machine, that can transport us back to some of our most treasured moments.   I treat my clients photos with as much care as I would give my own.
